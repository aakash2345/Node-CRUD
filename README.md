# Yeoman-Redux-ToDoApp

# In web development workflow, you would need to spend a lot of time setting up boilerplate code for your webapp, downloading dependencies, 
  and manually creating your web folder structure. Therefore Yeoman came in light to save time for developers.

# Install generator-fountain-webapp ---> to make use of fountain.js

# npm install --global generator-fountain-webapp

# Along with using npm install directly, you can search for generators via the Yeoman interactive menu. Run yo and select Install a 
  generator to search for published generators.

# Scaffolding, in the Yeoman sense of the word, means generating files for your web app based on your specific configuration requests.

# For this codelab, we will use React, Webpack, Babel, SASS and the Redux TodoMVC sample.
